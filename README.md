# Cloud Labs
This repository contains the python notebooks I have developed, together with [Giacomo Deodato](https://github.com/giacomodeodato), for the [Distributed systems and cloud computing](http://www.eurecom.fr/en/course/Clouds-2017Fall) course at Eurecom.

The goal of the first two notebooks was to study and apply machine learning algorithms, in particular Gradient Descent and K-means, in a distributed enviroment using Spark. The last lab instead is focused on data analysis through SparkSQL and data visualization with seaborn.
